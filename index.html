            <p>This site was created to give you a thorough understanding on the basics of JavaScript. Did you know
                Brendan Eich the architect of Javascript created it in 10 days. Obviously things have changed since the
                early days - so stick with us and you'll be coding in no time. </p>

            <h3>Arrays</h3>
            <p>Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations.
                Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed. Since an array's
                length can change at any time, and data can be stored at non-contiguous locations in the array,
                JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends on how the programmer chooses to use
                them. In general, these are convenient characteristics; but if these features are not desirable for your
                particular use, you might consider using typed arrays.
            </p>

            <h3>Function Scope</h3>

            <p>Variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from anywhere outside the function, because the
                variable is defined only in the scope of the function. However, a function can access all variables and
                functions defined inside the scope in which it is defined. In other words, a function defined in the
                global scope can access all variables defined in the global scope. A function defined inside another
                function can also access all variables defined in its parent function and any other variable to which
                the parent function has access.</p>

        <div class="column1">
            <h3>Objects</h3>
            <p>An object is an unordered list of primitive data types (and sometimes reference data types) that is
                stored as a series of name-value pairs. Each item in the list is called a property (functions are called
                methods).</p>


        </div>
        <div class="column2">
            <p>Consider this simple object:
                <br><br>
                <pre><code>var myFirstObject = {firstName: "Richard", favoriteAuthor: "Conrad"};</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>Think of an object as a list that contains items, and each item (a property or a method) in the list is
                stored by a name-value pair. The property names in the example above are firstName and favoriteAuthor.
                And the values are “Richard” and “Conrad.”


                Property names can be a string or a number, but if the property name is a number, it has to be accessed
                with the bracket notation.</p>
